    description:
      "During my 8 week work experience at Alf√∂ldi Printing House, I was tasked with developing a website that would enable the employees to order lunch, and for the vendors to check the orders and update the menu. I used NextJS for the frontend, NodeJS for the backend. I also used PocketBase for the database, and TailwindCSS, and Radix-UI for styling. Authentication is handled through cookies. Email services were solved with Resend. Hosting a showcase is a bit difficult, since it's a private app, but you can check out the code on Github.",

It's a clone of Windows 98, and it's built with HTML and CSS and a bit of JavaScript. ",
